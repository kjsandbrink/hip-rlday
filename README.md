# hip-rlday
Notebooks for a workshop introducing policy gradient methods. Initially held in Oxford in March 2023.

The "HIP_DeepRLDay_2023.ipynb" notebook contains exercises for participants to complete. They are recommended to create their own copies on Google Colab.

The "HIP_DeepRLDay_2023_solutions.ipynb" is the same notebook with answers to be filled in, to be gone through together once everyone has had a chance to work on their own.
